# Crop-Selection-through-Neural-Networks-Machine-learning-
• Agri predict is a novel framework aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural 
  growth through informed crop selection. Due to educational constraints and 
  limited access to precise information, farmers in India often make suboptimal 
  crop choices, overlooking essential factors like soil, climate, and 
  environmental conditions.  
• This leads to reduced yields and financial losses. To address this issue, we 
  propose the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically Neural Networks, 
  to predict optimal crop selections based on environmental and soil 
  parameters. The model considers critical factors such as Nitrogen, 
  Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Crop Type, Humidity, Rainfall, and ph.  
• The results demonstrate an impressive accuracy of over 98%, highlighting the 
  effectiveness of Agri predict in assisting farmers in making informed decisions 
  about crop selection.
